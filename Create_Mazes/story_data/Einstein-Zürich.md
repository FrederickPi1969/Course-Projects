Einstein decided to go further in the road of quantum and light, so he chose frontmost college in his era -- Swiss Polytechnic University in Zurich. However, there were many extraordinary students there, professors did not pay much attention to his. He spent four dull years there, though he meet his wife there, who also loved physics. After graduation, Einstein found it really hard to get a job with physics. But fortunately, the father of a classmate helped him obtain a job as a technical assistant examiner at the Swiss Patent Office.
