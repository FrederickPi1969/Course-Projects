Through out his life, he raise so many incredible theories:
General relativity
Special relativity
Photoelectric effect
E=mc2 (Mass–energy equivalence)
E=hf (Planck–Einstein relation)
Theory of Brownian motion
Einstein field equations
Bose–Einstein statistics
Bose–Einstein condensate
Gravitational wave
Cosmological constant
Unified field theory
EPR paradox
Ensemble interpretation

It's hard to imagine that these all were all based on imaginary experiments -- that is ligth, micro quantums, such stuffs are not accessible to an era that Einstein lives in. Einstein is remembered as a true Genius by later generations. He created a spelendid legend in human history.
